# GO-Game-Agent
Developed an AI agent for the game of Go on a 5x5 board, employing a tailored heuristic function and implementing the Minimax algorithm with Alpha Beta Pruning to strategically determine optimal moves up to a maximum depth of 3.

The AI agent reads the game board from the input file "input.txt" and provides the most favorable valid move as output in the "output.txt" file. Further information can be found in the document titled "Game Description.pdf".
